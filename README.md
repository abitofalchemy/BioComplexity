### A Summary of Complex Systems, Emergence, and Self-Organization

Emergence is a global property of a complex system exhibited as a function of self-organization that occurs at the local level.  Emergent properties of the system can often be categorized as bad (unpredictable or uncontrollable) or good (adaptable, flexible, or robust).  Self-organization is often described as a property that ‘spontaneously’ may occur, but I believe that self-organization (is another emergent property of a complex system) at the local level occurs as a function of the environment and doesn’t simply occur as a function of time.  The complex interactions between all agents at the microscopic (or local) scale or level react and evolve to the environment leading to a self-organization that is in synchrony with the system as whole.

## 08 Sept. 2015

* Feedback: Thursday
  - Eckhoff paper 1st 6 pages, until about the adult population; prepare to explain it. (2011)
  - Summarize Complex Systems / Emergence / Self-organization

* The Model: EMOD

### Entomological Inoculation Rate (EIR)
Per year the flow of parasites from mosq to people

### parasites
- human parasites
-


# EMOD Universe - IS Arc Sec No internal space
## Notes
* 40 or so diff. vectors pass on disease (agricultural water management practices)
* vector model is specific
* 2 species contribute to
* Common measures (EIR) # of times per year that a person ifece
* Sporozoite Rate (2-4pct. are byting have sporozoite in their salivary glands)


# Input parameters
- Temperature
- Rain fall
- Geo-location


## Mosquito biology
* The mosq Has to feed on people
* Human blood meal choise is an important phenom
* Mosq has to live long enough to do it's 1st blood meanl
* The model operates in time steps (1 day).
* Fem. mosq lay eggs in aquatic habitat
  * Hatch and develop
  * Adults emerge, mote, seek blood, digest blod and make more eggs
  * lay eggs  (repeat)
  * Probability (length of the event), but while taking a meal, the propb. of death increases.
* Other factors, rain, humid. , and temp (daily)
* Assumes loss of habitat is mainly due to evaporation
* The events occur faster with high temp

## 4 + constant Vector Habitats
Factors responding to
* constant
* temporary rain fall
* water vegetation
* human population
* brackis_swamp ?

##  sporozoite
The

## agents are defined independently of space.


## Curve Prevalence vs EIR
The lower the EIR, the lower the prevalence
