* Feedback: Thursday
  - Eckhoff paper 1st 6 pages, until about the adult population; prepare to explain it. (2011)
  - Summarize Complex Systems / Emergence / Self-organization
  -

* The Model: EMOD

### Entomological Inoculation Rate (EIR)
Per year the flow of parasites from mosq to people

### parasites
- human parasites
-


# EMOD Universe - IS Arc Sec No internal space
## Notes
* 40 or so diff. vectors pass on disease (agricultural water management practices)
* vector model is specific
* 2 species contribute to
* Common measures (EIR) # of times per year that a person ifece
* Sporozoite Rate (2-4pct. are byting have sporozoite in their salivary glands)


# Input parameters
- Temperature
- Rain fall
- Geo-location


## Mosquito biology
* The mosq Has to feed on people
* Human blood meal choise is an important phenom
* Mosq has to live long enough to do it's 1st blood meanl
* The model operates in time steps (1 day).
* Fem. mosq lay eggs in aquatic habitat
  * Hatch and develop
  * Adults emerge, mote, seek blood, digest blod and make more eggs
  * lay eggs  (repeat)
  * Probability (length of the event), but while taking a meal, the propb. of death increases.
* Other factors, rain, humid. , and temp (daily)
* Assumes loss of habitat is mainly due to evaporation
* The events occur faster with high temp

## 4 + constant Vector Habitats
Factors responding to
* constant
* temporary rain fall
* water vegetation
* human population
* brackis_swamp ?

##  sporozoite
The

## agents are defined independently of space.


## Curve Prevalence vs EIR
The lower the EIR, the lower the prevalence
